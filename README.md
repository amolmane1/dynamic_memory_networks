Tensorflow implementation of Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01417.pdf) 

DMN+ is a state of the art neural network architecture for question answering. It uses memory and attention mechanisms to solve problems like the following:

```
Input:
John went to the bedroom.
John picked up the football.
John went to the garden.

Question:
Where is the football?

Answer:
Garden
```

This implementation uses the Facebook babi dataset and can be trained on 20 different types of tasks like counting, reasoning, induction, deduction, path-finding, etc.

|   20|   |   |

For the future:Try and make DMN work with real-world text, like Wikipedia data. Find a use case for this architecture.
